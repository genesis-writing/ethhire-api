# Skill Minch API

> This is a Ruby on Rails API-only application for a jobs portal. The API allows users to create job postings, browse available jobs, and apply for jobs.

## Getting Started
To get started with the application
1. clone the repo and then install the needed gems:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:wuletawwonte/skillminch-api.git
cd skillminch-api
bundle install
```
2. Next, migrate the database:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```
3. Finally, start the server:

```bash
rails server
```
You can now use the API by sending requests to localhost:3000.
